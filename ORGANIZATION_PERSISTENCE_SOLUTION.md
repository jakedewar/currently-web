# Organization Persistence Solution

## Problem Description

The application had a critical issue with organization selection persistence across page navigation. When a user:

1. Selected an organization via the sidebar dropdown
2. Navigated to a new page/tab
3. The organization selection was lost and they were prompted to select an organization again

This created a poor user experience and broke the multi-tenant functionality.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was in the `OrganizationProvider` component:

1. **Problematic `hasInitialized` ref**: The provider used a `useRef` to track initialization state, which prevented the localStorage restoration logic from running on subsequent page navigations.

2. **Incomplete state restoration**: The provider only attempted to restore the organization selection once during initial load, but didn't handle cases where the component re-mounted or the organizations list changed.

3. **Race conditions**: The organization selection hook would show the modal before the provider had a chance to restore the saved selection from localStorage.

## Solution Implementation

### 1. Fixed Organization Provider (`components/organization-provider.tsx`)

**Key Changes:**
- Removed the problematic `hasInitialized` ref
- Modified the useEffect to run whenever organizations change, not just on initial load
- Added proper dependency array to include `currentOrganization`
- Added `clearCurrentOrganization` method for better state management

**New Logic:**
```typescript
// Load saved organization from localStorage whenever organizations change
useEffect(() => {
  if (typeof window !== 'undefined' && organizations.length > 0) {
    const savedOrgId = localStorage.getItem('selectedOrganizationId')
    
    if (savedOrgId) {
      const savedOrg = organizations.find(org => org.id === savedOrgId)
      if (savedOrg && (!currentOrganization || currentOrganization.id !== savedOrg.id)) {
        setCurrentOrganization(savedOrg)
      }
    }
    
    setIsLoading(false)
  } else if (typeof window !== 'undefined' && organizations.length === 0) {
    setIsLoading(false)
  }
}, [organizations, currentOrganization])
```

### 2. Improved Organization Selection Hook (`hooks/use-organization-selection.ts`)

**Key Changes:**
- Added `orgProviderLoading` to the dependency array
- Added check to prevent modal display while organization is being loaded from localStorage

**New Logic:**
```typescript
// Only show if we're not still loading the organization from localStorage
if (organizations.length > 0 && !currentOrganization && !orgProviderLoading) {
  setShowModal(true)
  setIsNewLogin(true)
  return
}
```

### 3. Fixed App Sidebar (`components/app-sidebar.tsx`)

**Key Changes:**
- Removed the `hasSyncedOrgs` ref that was preventing proper organization syncing
- Simplified the organization syncing logic to always sync when data changes

## How It Works Now

### 1. Initial Load
1. User visits the application
2. `OrganizationProvider` loads and starts in loading state
3. `useOrganizations` hook fetches user's organizations
4. Organizations are synced to the provider via `setOrganizations`
5. Provider checks localStorage for saved organization selection
6. If found and valid, the organization is restored
7. Loading state is set to false

### 2. Organization Selection
1. User selects an organization via sidebar dropdown
2. `setCurrentOrganization` is called
3. Organization is saved to localStorage immediately
4. All components using `useOrganization` receive the updated state

### 3. Page Navigation
1. User navigates to a new page
2. `OrganizationProvider` re-mounts or re-renders
3. Organizations are fetched again (or from cache)
4. Provider checks localStorage and restores the saved selection
5. No modal is shown because the organization is already selected

### 4. Organization Switching
1. User switches organizations via sidebar
2. New organization is immediately saved to localStorage
3. All data queries are invalidated and refetched with new organization context
4. User continues working with the new organization across all pages

## Testing the Solution

A debug component (`components/organization-debug.tsx`) has been created to help test the functionality:

- Shows current organization selection
- Lists all available organizations
- Provides buttons to switch organizations
- Shows localStorage state
- Allows clearing the selection

## Benefits

1. **Persistent Selection**: Organization choice persists across page navigation
2. **No Unnecessary Modals**: Users aren't prompted to select an organization when they already have one
3. **Immediate Switching**: Organization changes are applied instantly across the entire app
4. **Robust State Management**: Handles edge cases like missing organizations, localStorage errors, etc.
5. **Better UX**: Seamless multi-tenant experience

## Future Considerations

1. **Session Storage**: Consider using sessionStorage instead of localStorage for temporary selections
2. **Organization Validation**: Add validation to ensure the saved organization still exists and user has access
3. **Default Organization**: Consider auto-selecting the first organization if none is saved
4. **Organization Permissions**: Ensure organization switching respects user permissions

## Files Modified

- `components/organization-provider.tsx` - Fixed state persistence logic
- `hooks/use-organization-selection.ts` - Improved modal display logic
- `components/app-sidebar.tsx` - Simplified organization syncing
- `components/organization-debug.tsx` - Added for testing (new file)
